So, here the only contenders are Honda Crosstour vs Lexus NX 300h and the winner for big engine side is 2015 Honda Crosstour.","title":"Honda Crosstour vs Lexus NX 300h - Engine size (cc)"},{"content":"More cylinders usually comes with smaller cylinders. So, it needs smaller and lighter pistons makes it easier piston movement. So, you will have less vibrations in the car because they do not put lot of pressure on crankshaft. It also helps to increase overall rpm so you get smoother ride even on low gears with more power. However, note that more cylinders means smore friction generates so it needs more oil. If you are looking for a luxury car and needs less vibrations and more pwoer, the compteting cars would be Honda Crosstour vs Toyota Corolla and our recommendation would be 2015 Honda Crosstour.","title":"Honda Crosstour vs Lexus NX 300h - Engine Cylinder"},{"content":"3000 rpm means piston is moving 3000 times in one minute. So, definitely 3000 rpm produces more power than 2000 rpm engine. High rev engines are more suitable for race tracks than streets. In addition, high rev car can also give good power is lower gears. So, if you are carrying a high load in your car and need more power in lower speed, it better to have an engine which has more rpm. Based on this, the competing brands are Toyota Corolla vs Honda Crosstour. So, we suggest to go ahead with 2015 Toyota Corolla.","title":"Honda Crosstour vs Lexus NX 300h - Engine power (rpm)"},{"content":"During the 2015 Lexus NX 300h review for Engine Torque (rpm), we found that 2015 Lexus NX 300h has 0.0 , 2015 Toyota Corolla has 0.0 and 2015 Honda Crosstour has 0.0.\n                        Because given preference is Higher the better, it comes out that 2015 Toyota Corolla is the best because it has Engine Torque (rpm) as 0.0 which is Highest from others.
